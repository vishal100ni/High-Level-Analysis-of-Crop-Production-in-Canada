# High Level Analysis of Crop Production in Canada

## Assignment Scenario

Imagine you have just been hired by a US Venture Capital firm as a data scientist.

The company is considering foreign grain markets to help meet its supply chain requirements for its recent investments in the microbrewery and microdistillery industry, which is involved with the production and distribution of craft beers and spirits.

Your first task is to provide a high level analysis of crop production in Canada. Your stakeholders want to understand the current and historical performance of certain crop types in terms of supply and price. For now they are mainly interested in a macro-view of Canada's crop farming industry, and how it relates to the relative value of the Canadian and US dollars.

You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data analyst or data scientist would. You will also be asked to create four tables in Db2, and load the tables using the provided datasets from R using the RODBC package. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results, as well as the correctness of your table creation and data loading results.

## Objectives
- Understand four datasets
- Load the datasets into four separate tables in a Db2 database
- Execute SQL queries using the RODBC R package to answer assignment questions
## Steps Followed

- Problem 1: Create tables
- Problem 2: Read Datasets and Load Tables
- Problem 3: How many records are in the farm prices dataset?
- Problem 4: Which provinces are included in the farm prices dataset?
- Problem 5: How many hectares of Rye were harvested in Canada in 1968?
- Problem 6: Query and display the first 6 rows of the farm prices table for Rye.
- Problem 7: Which provinces grew Barley?
- Problem 8: Find the first and last dates for the farm prices data.
- Problem 9: Which crops have ever reached a farm price greater than or equal to $350 per metric tonne?
- Problem 10: Rank the crop types harvested in Saskatchewan in the year 2000 by their average yield. Which crop performed best?
- Problem 11: Rank the crops and geographies by their average yield (KG per hectare) since the year 2000. Which crop and province had the highest average yield since the year 2000?
- Problem 12: Use a subquery to determine how much wheat was harvested in Canada in the most recent year of the data.
- Problem 13: Use an implicit inner join to calculate the monthly price per metric tonne of Canola grown in Saskatchewan in both Canadian and US dollars. Display the most recent 6 months of the data.
